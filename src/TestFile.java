/*
 * Create a single Java class called ArchivalService that performs the following tasks:
 *
 * 1. For a given use case (e.g., "1.K") and a runId (e.g., 100):
 *    - Compute the run-specific folder path as: BASE_PATH/1.K/RunId_<runId>.
 *
 * 2. If the RunId folder does NOT exist:
 *    - Create the RunId folder and its subfolders: Input, Output, and Log.
 *    - Copy all files from the common Input folder (BASE_PATH/1.K/Input) into the run-specific Input folder.
 *    - For each file copied from the common Input folder, create an audit entry in the audit_log table with:
 *         - usecase_path = "1.K"
 *         - file_name = name of the file
 *         - file_size = human-readable size (B, KB, MB, or GB)
 *         - status = "Uploaded"
 *         - run_id = <runId>
 *
 * 3. If the RunId folder DOES exist:
 *    - Copy a specified file (e.g., "data.csv") from the common Staging folder (BASE_PATH/1.K/Staging) 
 *      to the run-specific Input folder (BASE_PATH/1.K/RunId_<runId>/Input).
 *    - After copying, check if an audit entry for this file exists:
 *         - If it exists, update the audit entryâ€™s status to "Moved".
 *         - If it does not exist, create a new audit entry with status "Moved".
 *
 * 4. In both cases, also copy files from the common Output folder (BASE_PATH/1.K/Output) to the run-specific Output folder.
 *
 * 5. Use a constant BASE_PATH to define the base directory.
 *
 * 6. Provide proper exception handling and logging using SLF4J.
 *
 * 7. The entire implementation should be contained within one class, ArchivalService, but methods should be clearly
 *    separated to handle different responsibilities:
 *      - A method for checking and creating directories.
 *      - A method for copying entire directories.
 *      - A method for copying individual files.
 *      - A method for moving files.
 *      - Methods for audit logging: one for checking if an audit entry exists, one for logging a new audit entry, and one for updating an existing audit entry.
 *
 * 8. Ensure the code is well-commented, follows clean code practices, and demonstrates clear separation of concerns within the single class.
 *
 * Generate the complete Java class code for ArchivalService that meets these requirements.
