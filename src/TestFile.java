Thank you for our earlier discussion regarding the role. After further consideration and reflecting on the scope of responsibilities and the market benchmarks for similar roles in the financial sector, I’d like to revise my expected salary range to £68,000–£78,000.

This adjustment better aligns with my skills, my experience as a backend developer, and my prior work with , which allows me to deliver immediate value. I apologize if this causes any inconvenience, and I appreciate your understanding as I clarify my expectations.

I remain very excited about the opportunity to join  and am happy to discuss this further to find a mutually agreeable outcome.
